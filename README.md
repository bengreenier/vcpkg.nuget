# vcpkg.nuget

[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) wrapped in [nuget](https://nuget.org)-y goodness ðŸ“¦

I needed a project local (not system wide) way to easily consume [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) that worked with no dependencies. This project aims to be that solution, distributed via [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vcpkg.Nuget/).

__Note: This only supports vcpkg running as part of msbuild, and therefore requires windows.__

## How to use

This package relies on `VcpkgPackage` msbuild tasks, that leverage the following format:

```xml
<VcpkgPackage Include="packageName"/>
```

Where `packageName` refers to the [vcpkg port](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports) you wish to install.

### Using Visual Studio

* Install the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vcpkg.Nuget/)
* Find the relevant ports you wish to install [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports)
* Add `VcpkgPackage` elements to your project file
* Building will ensure ports are built and installed

### Using the shell

* Install the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vcpkg.Nuget/)
* Import our build configuration in your project file:

```xml
<Import Project="packages\Vcpkg.Nuget.1.0.0-beta\build\Vcpkg.Nuget.props" Condition="Exists('packages\Vcpkg.Nuget.1.0.0-beta\build\Vcpkg.Nuget.props')" />
```

* Find the relevant ports you wish to install [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports)
* Add `VcpkgPackage` elements to your project file
* Building will ensure ports are built and installed
